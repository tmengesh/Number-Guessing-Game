# Number-Guessing-Game

A number guessing game that the app tries to guess a number that a user entered. As per each round, the user gives hint 
to the application that helps the app to adjust the lower and upper filling and continues guessing in the new range based 
on the hint received from the user.  

Once the app guessed the right number, we display the number and in how many rounds the app gets it right.
